Overseas Registration Department,

Co. Dublin, A94 R299 - Ireland
 

SUB: EXPLANATION FOR THE DESIGNATION OF SIGNATORY IN THE EMPLOYMENT FORM
 
I, CANDIDATEâ€™S_NAME, writing this letter to explain the designation of signatory in the NMBI employment form that was filled by my FIRST_OR_SECOND employer  - EMPLOYER_NAME.
I worked in EMPLOYER_NAME, ADDRESS from DDMMYYY to DDMMYYY. I was worked in the DEPARTMENT as a DESIGNATION. 
I have sent the NMBI Employment Form to the employer to fill in my details and indicated to the hospital authority that the form must be completed by the Nursing Director or Nursing Manager as stated in the form itself. But the form was filled out by SIGNATORY_NAME who is the DESIGNATION in EMPLOYER_NAME.
I have requested them to get it refilled by the Nursing Director, but they refused, and I could not insist them more because I was informed by the employer that as per their policy, the Infection SIGNATORY_NAME, DESIGNATION is responsible for my NMBI employment form completion since I worked in DEPARTMENT under her direct supervision and not with Nursing Department.
In addition to this letter, I have submitted a document I received from the employer that states the above.

Yours Sincerely,                                                                                            Date: 
Name: CANDIDATEâ€™S_NAME
