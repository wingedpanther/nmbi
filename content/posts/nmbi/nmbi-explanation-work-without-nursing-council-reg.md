My Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSc. Nursing) degree was awarded in MONTH YEAR by UNIVERSITY_NAME in STATE, India, and I obtained my Nursing Registration on the DATE from the NURSING_COUNCIL_NAME.
My first job after registering with the NURSING_COUNCIL_NAME.was with the HOSPITAL_NAME, STATE, India from DATE to DATE.

Yours Sincerely,                                                                                            Date:
