**Email Subject: Request for GNIB Appointment(First time registration)**

Dear Immigration Officer,

I am writing to request an appointment to obtain a GNIB. I understand that this card is necessary to prove my right to be in Ireland and to access certain services.
I am available to attend an appointment at your earliest convenience and I would be grateful if you could provide me with a list of available dates and times. I would prefer an appointment that is as soon as possible, as my current visa is expiring soon.
My information is,
1. Full name as in passport: 
2. Date of birth (Day Month Year): 
3. Permanent address:
4. IRP expiry date:
5. Contact number:
6. Do you have all documents (hard, original copies only) ready?: Yes
7. Is this appointment request for renewal or for first time registration or stamp change?: First time registration.

I have original documents available with me including proof of address as well.

Please let me know if there is any additional information or documentation that I need to bring with me to the appointment. I have read the information on the INIS website regarding the documents required for first-time registration and I will ensure that I have everything that is necessary.

I appreciate your prompt attention to my request and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
