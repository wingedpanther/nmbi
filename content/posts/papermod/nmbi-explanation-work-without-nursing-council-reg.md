DECLARATION: WORKING WITH AN ACTIVE NURSING REGISTRAION FROM ANOTHER STATE IN INDIA 

I completed my (qualification details - BSc/GNM) in (Month/Year). I completed my nursing registration on
(date) with the (name of nursing council). 
Following my registration with the (name of nursing council), I was employed with (name of
hospital/health center) from (start date) to (end date). During my tenure at (name of hospital/health
center) we were not required to register with the (name of nursing council) as long as we had an activeregistration from one of the Nursing Councils in India. This was a practice back in the day and was followedby most of the hospitals in India during this time frame. 
I trust this clarifies the query raised.
Should you need any further details, please feel free to get in touch with me.

Yours Sincerely,
