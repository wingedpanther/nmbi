            DECLARATION: UNABLE TO GET EMPLOYMENT VERIFICATION FROM PREVIOUS EMPLOYER

I have been an employee of (Name of hospital/health centre) from (start date) to (end date).  Itsâ€™s been 
close to 10 years since I have left the above-mentioned organization. 
I have been trying to reach the nursing in-charge, but unfortunately there has been no favorable response 
till date. Also, with the current pandemic situation in India and with most states/area in lockdown, it is
extremely difficult to also physically visit them (and I am currently working in Dubai, UAE).  
As proof of work experience, I have the experience letter issued by the hospital/health centre.
I trust this clarifies the query raised with regards to employment verification form.
Should you need any further details, please feel free to get in touch with me.

Yours Sincerely,
Name:
